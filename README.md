# Voice_assistant
This is a Python-based voice assistant that captures the desktop screen, accepts user prompts via speech, and provides answers through generated audio. It uses OpenAI for speech-to-text and text-to-speech (TTS), and it leverages a model from Google Generative AI for processing prompts.
